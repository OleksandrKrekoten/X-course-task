          <span><strong>Description: </strong></span>JavaScript is the
          programming language of the web and is used by more software
          developers today than any other programming language. For nearly 25
          years this best seller has been the go-to guide for JavaScript
          programmers. The seventh edition is fully updated to cover the 2020
          version of JavaScript, and new chapters cover classes, modules,
          iterators, generators, Promises, async/await, and metaprogramming.
          Youâ€™ll find illuminating and engaging example code throughout. This
          book is for programmers who want to learn JavaScript and for web
          developers who want to take their understanding and mastery to the
          next level. It begins by explaining the JavaScript language itself, in
          detail, from the bottom up. It then builds on that foundation to cover
          the web platform and Node.js.
